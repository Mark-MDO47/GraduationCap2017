When print started there was a slight mis-registration between the first raft outline layer and the next.
It looked to be on track after that and was still looking good a few hours later.
After about 8 hours it showed signs of warping up off the bed from one corner that was hanging off the first raft outline layer (in the air)
Next morning it was a disaster.
 The raft and start of the print were pushed off the bed.
 The printer hot end was still spewing and was completely coated with plastic.
 Even the wires to the hot end were encapsulated.
 477 thru 479

Fortunately when I heated up to pull the filament out the encapsulation was brittle.
  Small manipulations made pieces that could pull off with needle-nose.
  Even the plastic around the wires came apart, though I was worried.
  484 thru 485

Additional cleanup makes it look almost like before. Will have to see if it works
