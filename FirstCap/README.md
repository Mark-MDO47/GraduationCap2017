FirstGradCap.mp4 - video of cap with all four LED disks doing same pattern

P1010498.JPG - start of wiring - finished 3 of 6 buttons - that is enough!!!
P1010499.JPG - different view
P1010500.JPG - different view

P1010501.JPG - switch for LED power - uses 5.5Kohm to ground for internal light
P1010502.JPG - detail of switch for LED power
P1010503.JPG - added some connectors, made mistake for Arduino power-in (missed knife switch). Note attempting knots for strain relief.
P1010506.JPG - all Arduinos wired & 3 buttons. Using cable tie for strain relief, color coded cable tie to identify connectors. Still error for Arduino power.
P1010508.JPG - starting on 2nd controller board, still have not noticed Arduino power error.
P1010509.JPG - closeup 2nd controller board showing Arduino Nano soldering
